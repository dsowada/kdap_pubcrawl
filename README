Pubcrawl Planner – Streamlit Application

This project is a local Streamlit-based web application that recommends and visualizes
a pub crawl route based on bar data, distances, and user-defined preferences.

The application is designed to run locally without complications, provided that all
required dependencies are installed correctly.
Also you can visit the website visited on https://pubcrawl.streamlit.app/

PREREQUISITES:

2) CREATE AND ACTIVATE THE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT

Using a virtual environment (venv) is mandatory to avoid dependency conflicts.

Linux:

==================================================
3) INSTALL ALL REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES

All Python packages required for this application are listed in requirements.txt.
They MUST be installed before starting the application.

4) START THE STREAMLIT APPLICATION


After activating the virtual environment and installing all dependencies,
